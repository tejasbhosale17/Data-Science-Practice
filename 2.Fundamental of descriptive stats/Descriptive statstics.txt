
* The various type of data in descriptive statistcs - 
* clasify the data in 2 main ways - <A> Types <B> Measurment Levels

=============================================================================================================================================
<A> types of data - Categorical data & Numerical data - 

** CATEGORICAL DATA --
   # categorical data describes categories & groups -
	@ car brands - bmw, mercedes, audi - they show us different category
   
** NUMERICAL DATA --  Discrete Data & Continuous Data
   # Discrete Data is count by finite manner e.g - no. of childern which is integer value from 0 to 10
   # Other example is Students grade in the exam - Fail or Pass ( you may get score of 1000,1700 or 2000) main important is variable 
     to define you can imagine each member in the dataset knowing the score from 1000 - 2400

* continuous data is infinitive & impossible to count. e.g - A persons weight is 68kg & after few days if you gain weight then ur weight 
  become 69kg & A person's new weight would be 69kg. If A person is keep on working or running you get sweating.so that means reduce 
  your weight but the weights scale is keep on changeing. The process of lossing & gaining occurs all the time. 
  your exact weight is contiunus variable

* Discrete data is No. of children - you can easily count- linear reg is discrete in nature
  Continuos data is weight of the person - log regressio is continuous in nature

=============================================================================================================================================
<B> Measurment levels - How to find the levels of measurment split 2 groups - Qulitive and Quantive

    * Qualitative data - * Nominal and Ordinal Data - 
                         Nominal values are type of category- bmw,audi 
			 4 season-summer,winter,rain,spring - they are numbers can not put in any order
     			
			* ORDINAL DATA- If i ask you to rate your lunch from 1-5
			  1>disgusting 2>unappetizing 3>neutral4>tasty5>delicious
	
                          what we did hear is assigned all words to numbers and the ordering is from negative to positive & data is qualitive ordinal
    * Quantitative data - * Interval * Ratio. 
			  * Interval & Ratio both are majored by number but main differece :- Ratio has a true 0 and interval has no 0 value
			  * Interval variable example is Temperature (Cel/Far) & we can say 80 degr farenhite is less then 100 degr farenhite.
			  * Ration example is Length 0 has some meaning in length

<c> Visualization technique for categorial Variables - 

* Representation of categorial variables - Frequency distribution tables,Bar charts,Pie charts,Pareto Diagrams

* Frequency distribution table - It is Tabular format showing category name along with freaquency.In simple i would say that no. of car sold, 
  this is one of the way to organise the data. using the same table we will construct the bar chart

* Bar chart --- vertical - No. of units sold, horizonatal - it shows different category (we have more clarity about variables)

* Pie chart -- same way we can represent the pie chart. additioanal you can get relative freaquency based on % & pie chart we can see the 
  share of the total & this is the best for business example & market shares. check in the google about market share. Relative frequency 
  is the percentage of the total frequency for each category. (RF= INDIVIDUAL FREQUENCY/TOTAL FREQUENCY)

* Pareto diagram-- this is special type of bar chart.Categories are shown in descending order of frequency.(Frequencey is the nmber of occurance 
  on each items)  let me order the frequency using bar chart & curve showing and this is pareto diagram by using cumulative frequency & % plot 
  drawn as per right side vertical axis.(CF is the sum of RF) pareto diagrams combine the bar chart & pie chart. its easy to compare the data both 
  category as well as total, by using this u can check the market share. 

<D> Frequency distribution for Numeriacl Variables -

* we will do main focus on numeric data only & as per the given table each number occurs 1 time, frquency = 1

* when we deal with numeic variables then it more sense to group the data into intervals then find the coresponding freaquency

* what is intervals & how to choose intervals( statisticians prefers 5-20 intervals, intervals depends on case to case . intervals depend 
  on large amount of data

* Each interval has width of 20 & lets try to construct the frequency distribution table, as per table you get the interval & frequency

* we calculate the interval & frequency & no we can calculate the relative frequency and now we can plot using histogram. histogram is best way 
  to plot the datapoints. (RF== TOTAL FREQ / FREQ)== 20/2) ///// Rf = ABSO FRE/FREQ

*** HISTOGRAM --  in histogram x-axis is for interval width, y-axis is for frequency or relative frequ
    difference between Bar chart & histogram ( bar chart - no interval) 

* u may creat a histogram with unequal width( age group you may have different interval width) so how to take interval with becuase below 18 is not 
  acceptable & over age of 60 is not applicable. thats why we come to conclusion as 18-25//25 -30//30-35/60+

* final conclusion of histogram is always prefer of equal width.

* This we called univariate analysis & we covered graphs with only 1 variable & below is the process of relationsip between 2 variables
==================================================================================================================================================
<E> Cross table & Scatter plot - we have 2 variables categorical variable & numerical variable

* categorical variable are represent in cross table & some statician called as continuous table

* imagine your manager for the investment and you have a stocks, bonds, realestate --> investor A, B & C 

* if you calculate total for row & column wise both you get the same result, it will show us total investment of stock,bonds,real estate as per 
  vertical axis horizontal you can get the subtotal of holding of each instor 

* now we are visualize the table using cross table using slide-by-slide bar chart & side-by-side bar chart is variation of bar chart

* all 3 are in 3 different colour. we can easily figure out the investor with how much of investing on 3 different sectors

* All graphs are very easy to create and read, once you have idenitified the type of data.
 
* scatte plot represent only 2 numeric data - as per the table we have sat score of reading & writng score of 100 individual

* sat score ranging from 200 -800 right , y -axis --- writing, x-axis --- reading score & each data points gives us students performance

* scatter plot represents the lot of observation & the key insight from this graph is low reading score obtain the low writing score
   high reading score obtains the high writing scores. 

* insigt is if you look at the 500 points & lot of people get that score. 

* last insight is there few pair of students extremly well, very high writing and reading

* if you check the one point and this observation is called outlier

we understand the Basic of descriptive statistics - 

-- population 
-- sampletypes of variables
-- measurment levels
